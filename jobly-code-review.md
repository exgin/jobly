- the best solutions are generally the simplest
- add tests that don't work!
- testing is the best way to learn & improve
- send an insomia & postman file (a file with JSON) to have others test & use my backend code
- instead of Truncating, DELETE, since DELETE will remove the foregin key restraints
- add more comments on a route to see how it works
